# Do multiple designs

It has been proven repeatedly that the first idea is not necessarily the best idea. Even though it can be difficult to see past the first design you have, forcing yourself to think outside the box and come up with alternate designs will help you to find the best design. This will happen either by helping you find a second or third design that is better than your first or will help you see why your initial design is actually the best one. 

We recommend spending at least triple the time you used to come up with the initial design to come up with alternate designs.

You can do this for major design decisions, such as should we lead them through making a graph or should we just show all possible graphs at once, as well as smaller ones, such as where to put a button.
