# Consistency within the tool, with other similar tools, and the internet at large

Make sure language, labels, etc. are consistent throughout the interface. If you refer to something using a word or phrase in one place, use that word/phrase elsewhere. Same with colors, button designs, etc

Mimics what is already out there. If it's familiar that will be good. You can do something completely different but unless it's a lot different it's not going to catch on

Need to create metaphors that people understand and are grounded in familiar tasks

Design needs to be usable in the context/space/time in which it needs to be used

Consistency of presentation will make it appear easier to learn and reliability
