# Best design practices

Make sure language, labels, etc. are consistent throughout the interface. If you refer to something using a word or phrase in one place, use that word/phrase elsewhere. Same with colors, button designs, etc

Mimics what is already out there. If it's familiar that will be good. You can do something completely different but unless it's a lot different it's not going to catch on

Need to create metaphors that people understand and are grounded in familiar tasks

Design needs to be usable in the context/space/time in which it needs to be used

Consistency of presentation will make it appear easier to learn and reliability  


A design should try to reduce the gap between what the user is used to and the new technology

mental models

Offload working memory whenever you can! Don't make people remember anything that you can put on the screen

Whitespace conveys grouping

Size of text contrast implies hierarchy
