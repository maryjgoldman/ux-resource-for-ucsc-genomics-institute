# Basic accessibility

color blindness colors/options, alt tags for the blind

Access to the web is a basic human right, meaning that anyone should be able to use and access sites on the web. There are common, low-hanging things you can do to make your website accessible:

* Color-blind friendly color palettes, or options to enable a color-blind friendly mode
* Alt-text on images to that the blind can have images described to them

If you have access to people in your group that are colorblind, they may be a good litmus test for colors.

Good to keep these things in mind from the beginning as it means you can avoid having to make massive changes later after discovering something
