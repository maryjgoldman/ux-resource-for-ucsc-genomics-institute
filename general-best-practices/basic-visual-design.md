# The Basics of Visual Design

## Goals of Visual Design

There are **three** goals for visual design

1. **Guide people**: convey structure, relative importance and relationships
2. **Pace the interaction**: draw people in, help orient, provide hooks for diving deeper
3. **Express the message**: tell the story, breathe life into the content  

## 1. Guiding People 

### Conveying Relationships

* Whitespace conveys grouping
* Size of text contrast implies hierarchy

### Readability

* If you're doing something that people will read, pick a common typeface that folks are familiar with
* Left-aligned is easier to read






## 2. Pacing Interactions

### Icons

Generic icons rarely help - make them specific  

Icons are good when they show what the represent, either to help me the first time or the second time when i return

Icons are also good as redundant coding  

### Use of Color

Use color sparingly and effectively - know why you're using a color somewhere

If you're doing a logo or something extraordinary, pick something uncommon to make you stick out.  

Fewer colors is better

### Patterns

Using alignment well helps guide your eye and reduce clutter

We automatically notice patterns and also deviations from them, so use patterns when you want to convey consistency, and deviate from them only when you intentionally want to distinguish that content.  

Avoid slight misalignments, because they undermine your ability to beacon the organization. 

### Links

How to make better informational links

Make them longer - multi word \(this will help with accessibility too since readers will read out whole link\)

Use trigger words, not 'clever' terms. These are commonly known words. Also use words that your user will know, not what words the design team wants to use  
In general though, follow the example of other similar sites

If you put your navigation where a similar site puts their navigation that will help users get used to yours  

Information scent


## 3. Expressing a Message

## Other Advice











Put the most important things above the fold

Studies do show that users are happy to scroll if they think they'll be rewarded  

People don't read on the web! People often have a number of tabs open simultaneously. Are even doing unrelated tasks at the same time! So make text scannable - shorter is better, use bullet lists, don't use market-ese
