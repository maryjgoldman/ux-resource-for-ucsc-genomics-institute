# Best general design

## Be Consistent

Make sure language, labels, etc. are consistent throughout the interface. If you refer to something using a word or phrase in one place, use that word/phrase elsewhere. Same with colors, button designs, etc

Consistency of presentation will make it appear easier to learn and reliability

## Mental Models

Users will come to your application with a mental model of how it works and what they are expecting to do on your application. It is important to keep to this mental model as much as possible, or otherwise make it clear what the model is for your application.

When showing the model for your application, it is good to ground it in familiar tasks, either elsewhere on the web \(screen loading bar\) or in real life \(odometer like gauge to show how fast something is running\).

Offload working memory whenever you can! Don't make people remember anything that you can put on the screen
