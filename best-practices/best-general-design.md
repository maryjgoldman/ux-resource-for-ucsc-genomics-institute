# Best general design

### Be Consistent

Make sure language, labels, etc. are consistent throughout the interface. If you refer to something using a word or phrase in one place, use that word/phrase elsewhere. Same with colors, button designs, etc

Consistency of presentation will make it appear easier to learn and reliability  

### Create Mental Models

mental models

Offload working memory whenever you can! Don't make people remember anything that you can put on the screen

### Understand Similar Tools

Mimics what is already out there. If it's familiar that will be good. You can do something completely different but unless it's a lot different it's not going to catch on

Need to create metaphors that people understand and are grounded in familiar tasks

A design should try to reduce the gap between what the user is used to and the new technology

### Other

Design needs to be usable in the context/space/time in which it needs to be used
