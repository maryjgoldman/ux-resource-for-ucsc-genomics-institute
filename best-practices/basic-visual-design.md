# Basic visual design

## Conveying Relationships

* Whitespace can be used to convey groupings. Things closer together \(i.e. with less whitespace between them\) are percieved as related.
* The contrast between sizes of text implies a hierarchy. Use large/bold text for titles, slighter smaller text for subsections, and even smaller text for the body. 

## Typography

* For something that people will need to read, pick a common, familiar typeface.
* Left-aligned text is easier to read.

## Icons

* Generic icons rarely help - make them specific
* Icons are good when they show what they represent, either to help me the first time or the second time when i return
* Icons are also good as redundant coding

## Use of Color

* Fewer colors is better. If you use color, do so sparingly but effectively - think about why you're using color.
* If you're doing a logo or something extraordinary, pick something uncommon to make you stick out.

## Patterns

* We automatically notice patterns and deviations from them. Use patterns when you want to convey consistency, and deviate when you intentionally want to distinguish that content.
* Using alignment well helps guide your eye and reduce clutter
* Avoid slight misalignments, because they undermine your ability to beacon the organization.
* If you put your navigation where a similar site puts their navigation that will help users get used to yours

## Links

How to make better informational links:

* Make the link text a long, muti-word phrase \(this will help with accessibility too since readers will read out whole link\). Avoid links that are just the word "here".
* Use **trigger words**, not 'clever' terms. These are commonly known words. Also use words that your user will know, not what words the design team wants to use

  In general though, follow the example of other similar sites

* Understand [information scent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/). When looking for information, people will skim pages looking for key words related to what they are searching for. If a page doesn't seem immediately relevant, people will leave the page and look on other pages -- even if the current page may actually contain all of the information they're looking for. Many people surf the web the skimming pages looking for words

## Other Advice

* Put the most important things above the fold
* Studies do show that users are happy to scroll if they think they'll be rewarded
* People don't read on the web! People often have a number of tabs open simultaneously. Are even doing unrelated tasks at the same time! So make text scannable - shorter is better, use bullet lists, don't use market-ese
