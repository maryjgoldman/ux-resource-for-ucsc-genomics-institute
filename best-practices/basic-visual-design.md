# Basic Design Principles

Design is a complex topic. It pulls from a long history of studies of human psychology, sociology, and human computer interaction. However, it's not necessary to dive deep into topic to be able to take advantage of some these results. 

## Goals of Design

There are **three** goals for design

1. **Guide people**: convey structure, relative importance and relationships
2. **Pace the interaction**: draw people in, help orient, provide hooks for diving deeper
3. **Express the message**: tell the story, breathe life into the content  

Keep these goals in mind as you create your tools. As you read through the advice in the sections below, think about you can tie them into the design goals.

## Conveying Relationships

* Whitespace can be used to convey groupings. Things closer together \(i.e. with less whitespace between them\) are percieved as related.
* The contrast between sizes of text implies a hierarchy. Use large/bold text for titles, slighter smaller text for subsections, and even smaller text for the body. 

## Typography

* For something that people will need to read, pick a common, familiar typeface.
* Left-aligned text is easier to read.

## Icons

* Avoid generic icons, they rarely help. Make them specific.
* Good icons show what they represent, either to help me the first time or the second time when I return.
* Good icons can also be used redundant coding. If an icon and text are used together, someone might not understand the text but may understand the icon.  

## Use of Color

* Use color sparingly but effectively - think about why you're using color and what you are trying to tell the user with that color.
* If you're doing a logo or something extraordinary, pick something uncommon to make you stick out.

## Patterns

* We automatically notice patterns and deviations from them. Use patterns when you want to convey consistency, and deviate when you intentionally want to distinguish that content.
* Using alignment well helps guide your eye and reduce clutter
* Avoid slight misalignments, because they undermine your ability to beacon the organization.
* If you put your navigation where a similar site puts their navigation that will help users get used to yours

## Links

How to make better informational links:

* Make the link text a long, muti-word phrase \(this will help with accessibility too since readers will read out whole link\). Avoid links that are just the word "here".
* Use **trigger words**, not 'clever' terms. These are commonly known words. Also use words that your user will know, not what words the design team wants to use.
* Understand [information scent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/). When looking for information, people will skim pages looking for key words related to what they are searching for. If a page doesn't seem immediately relevant, people will leave to look elsewhere -- even if the current page may actually contain all of the information they're looking for. 

## Be Consistent

Consistency is key. If your website behaves in a way consistent with itself (and with things they've seen before) it can help offload the difficult task of understanding how to interact with a tool. If every new page is completely different from the last, the user has to actively think about how to use every page, slowing them down. This consistency can also make your site appear easier to learn, as it will draw on interactions the user already knows. 

Consistency isn't just about behavior, but it's also about language, labels, colors, button designs. It's really everything. If you use a word to refer to an interection in one place, use that same word elsewhere.

## Other Advice

* Put the most important things above the fold
* Studies do show that users are happy to scroll if they think they'll be rewarded
* People don't read on the web! People often have a number of tabs open simultaneously. Are even doing unrelated tasks at the same time! So make text scannable - shorter is better, use bullet lists, don't use market-ese
* In general though, follow the example of other similar sites that you think are designed well.
