# Goals of Visual Design

There are **three** goals for visual design

1. **Guide people**: convey structure, relative importance and relationships
2. **Pace the interaction**: draw people in, help orient, provide hooks for diving deeper
3. **Express the message**: tell the story, breathe life into the content
