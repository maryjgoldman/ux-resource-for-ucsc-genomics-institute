# Think about how this tool will fit into a user's larger goals, workflow, skillset

How does this tool fit into someone's larger goals, motivations? How does it fit into their workflow? Come up with plausible actions/stories that someone might take while using your tool. Use these stories to guide development and define core features.

What do people do now?  ****When do they do it? What values and goals do they have? 

How are the particular things that you're observing embedded in a larger ecology of artifacts and social networks and broader career and personal and professional goals? 

Similarities and differences across people?  
Look for workarounds and hacks - post it notes, light switch that's taped on, etc

"Errors" are a goldmine

â†’ these things are even more important because it's not just what they say, it's what they do

  
Also note that what people say they want is not necessarily what is best for your business. People may say they don't want candy by the checkout but if you're trying to sell candy, it is the thing to do even though people say they don't want it

Lead and power/extreme users can be a source of ideas - don't discount them!

Power/Extreme users - Users who are really using a product a lot OR people who very rarely use a product

These users are great when you're really at the beginning of an idea or tool

Pay attention to hacks that lead or power users are doing

Caveat: keep in mind that they may not be the true end user
