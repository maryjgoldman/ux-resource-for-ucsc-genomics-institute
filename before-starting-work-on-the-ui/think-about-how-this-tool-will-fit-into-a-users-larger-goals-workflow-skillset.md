# Think about the user's context

It is important before beginning to think at least some about the larger picture, especially about the user's context. This will influence your core design decisions, such as 'Does this tool even need a GUI?' 

## Context to consider

* Who is the user of this tool?
  * And don't just say 'Everyone!'



What is the skillset of my users? Do they have experience with the command line? Do they prefer to use R or Python or something else? Do they use Linux?

How will they be using the results from the tool? Will they be publishing using the results? Are there any requirements for publishing? Will they be showing the results to other coworkers? Who are those coworkers? 

how this tool will fit into a user's larger goals, workflow, skillset

How does this tool fit into someone's larger goals, motivations? How does it fit into their workflow? Come up with plausible actions/stories that someone might take while using your tool. Use these stories to guide development and define core features.

What do people do now?  ****When do they do it? What values and goals do they have? 

How are the particular things that you're observing embedded in a larger ecology of artifacts and social networks and broader career and personal and professional goals? 

Similarities and differences across people?

## Talking to potential users

Look for workarounds and hacks - post it notes, light switch that's taped on, etc

"Errors" are a goldmine

â†’ these things are even more important because it's not just what they say, it's what they do

Power/Extreme users - Users who are really using a product a lot OR people who very rarely use a product

Pay attention to hacks that lead or power users are doing

Caveat: keep in mind that they may not be the true end user

## Putting it into writing

User Stories/Storyboards are a great way to show how the user will be using the tool. They help

* cement what you've observed and learned
* remind yourself of the ultimate goal for the tool
* remind stakeholders and coworkers of the ultimate goal for the tool
