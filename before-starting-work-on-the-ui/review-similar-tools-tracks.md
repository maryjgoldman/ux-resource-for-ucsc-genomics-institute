# Check out other tools/applications

Before starting the layout of the user interface or how a user will move through the tool/application it is important to see what else is out there. This will help you see see what the conventions other tools are following as well as inspire new interfaces. This is good to do whether starting from scratch or refining/revising a current interface. 

## Three types of tools to look at

1. Tools/applications that do as close to what you are doing as possible
2. Tools/applications in your field in general
3. Tools/applications outside of genomics/biology/etc

The first group will help you brainstorm ideas from what other people have done, and also see what improvements you can make on competitors in the field. The second will help you understand general paradigms and conventions in the field \(e.g. introns being represented as lines and exons as boxes\). The final group will help you think outside the box and find novel ways of guiding users and presenting information.
