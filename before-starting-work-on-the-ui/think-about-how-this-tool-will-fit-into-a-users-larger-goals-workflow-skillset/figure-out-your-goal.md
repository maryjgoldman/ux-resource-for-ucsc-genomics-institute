# Figure out your goal

After doing need finding, set design goals

All design is redesign. People are already accomplishing their goals but might be in a very different way than you're proposing

This is why need-finding it important. Need to find closest thing so that accurately understand people's goals, when they are doing \(i.e. context\)  


How connect observations to the design? What's the lever?  


What matters in a design?

Design is more than just laying things out on a page

It's deciding what is important and meaningful and what isn't. Helps you know where to focus your energies as a designer

Conceptual representation - Make the user's goals, and what important explicit so that you don't fall into the trap of the first thing you think of

This is good for communicating with stakeholders, being mindful and also to be more creative since you're taking several smaller steps rather than one large step  


* What does this conceptual representation look like? \(since it's not a design\)
* What are the steps?
* What are the artifacts?
* What are the goals? \(and how you'll measure success\) immediate and larger abstract goals
* What are the pain points? 

Good to put it all up on a wall so that all the stakeholders, clients, users, etc can see where things are going
