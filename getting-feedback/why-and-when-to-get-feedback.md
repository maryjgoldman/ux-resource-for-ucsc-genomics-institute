# Why and when to get feedback

## Remember: you are not the target user.

In virtually all cases, you are not the target user for your tool. Your target user will have a different skillset, different goals, etc. This means that what seems obvious for you may be difficult for your users. Alternatively, something that you worry will be complicated will actually be quite easy for them.

## Who should you run it by?

Ideally you would run it by a user or potential user of your tool. You can get in contact with users by leveraging either a mailing list, poster session, etc to get contact information for a potential user. You can get in contact with potential users by leveraging other groups at the Genomics Institute to see if they have access to users who might want to use your tool.

If you don't have access to users or potential users, you next best option is a coworker, ideally one who has as close to the same skillet that you are trying to target. 

Typically, PIs, managers, etc are not great people to get feedback from. They will have lots of ideas of what to do, but since they are not your target user, they will just be dreaming up what sounds good. That said, they do understand what is fundable and what funders are looking for, so they can be useful for feedback in that direction.

## How many people should you run it by?

Industry rules is 3-5, but in practice, even one person will **significantly** help you. Research shows that 1 person can help you find up to 1/3 of the usability bugs with a tool.

## When should you run it by someone?

Ideally early and often. Interestingly, you can often get the best feedback from users when your designs are the roughest \(paper and pencil, slides, etc\), because users feel more free to give frank feedback because they know you haven't invested so much time in it that you can't pivot to something else.

That said, even running it by someone only once during the design of a tool is good.
