# When should you get feedback

Ideally early and often. Interestingly, you can often get the best feedback from users when your designs are the roughest \(paper and pencil, slides, etc\), because users feel more free to give frank feedback because they know you haven't invested so much time in it that you can't pivot to something else.

That said, even running it by someone only once during the design of a tool is good.
