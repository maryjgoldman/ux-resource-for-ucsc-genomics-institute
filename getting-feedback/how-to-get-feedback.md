# How to get feedback

* Don't ask leading questions. 
* Don't suggest actions. Just watch them. You will bias them
* Don't ask them if they like it. People will say they like it but then won't use it because while they like the concept it doesn't actually work for them

* They will struggle. It's ok.

* When testing, note the language they use. Use this same language for buttons, drop downs, etc
* Don't take feedback personally.  Feedback is an essential way to effectively evolve a design.   Often user's are most frustrated with tools that they want the most that don't quite work perfectly.   That being said, also ask user's what works within the current design so you \(A\) know what to keep and \(B\) recognize that there is value in the designs.
