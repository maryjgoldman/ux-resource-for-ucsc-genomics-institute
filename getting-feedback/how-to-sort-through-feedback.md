# How to sort through feedback

What is important and what is not. What to do with feedback that is out of scope for a refinement of a feature.

Also note that what people say they want is not necessarily what is best for your business. People may say they don't want candy by the checkout but if you're trying to sell candy, it is the thing to do even though people say they don't want it. An example: it may be good to slow a user down so they think about the implications of an analysis, etc.
